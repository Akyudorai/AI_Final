DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple dropper game with peggle-like elements to have the ball bounce around where you compete against an AI agent. 

OBJECTIVE:
> Get the ball past the AI controlled basket at the bottom.
> You'll earn a win for every time you get it past.
> The AI will earn a win for every 5 times it stops your ball from getting past it.
> There is no ending condition for the game.  Play as long as you like.

CONTROLS:
> Use your mouse to move your UFO character back and forth across the screen.
> Use the left mouse button to drop the ball.
> You can only drop one ball at a time.

NOTES:
There is presently no closing functionality, so to close the game, you'll have to resort to quitting using Alt + F4 key combination.
